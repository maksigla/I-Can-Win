Look, I got a text from this girl I used to see
Sayin' that she chose this other guy with whom she wanna be with
Look, I apologize, but this message fucked me up
Then I would skeet-skeet every girl after replying, "Best of luck to ya"
Fast forward couple months I'm like, "Wassup witcha?"
'Cause somethin' changed I know ya feel it (Feel it)
But really it's been a lil' minute
Ain't nothin' changed but the address
My neighbors hate how I be livin' (Livin')
Mad it's a loud rich nigga in the buildin'
Like fuck all the other tenants (Runnin')
Bought mines, boy, you rentin' (Runnin')
Rich niggas in their feelings (Runnin')
Bitch niggas in their feelings (Woo)
